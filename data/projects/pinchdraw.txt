Project: PinchDraw
Description: The Real-time Camera Pinch Draw App is a browser-based tool that lets you draw directly on a live camera feed using only your hand gestures.
It uses your device’s camera and real-time hand tracking to detect when you pinch your thumb and index finger together — starting a brush stroke. Opening your hand stops drawing.
The camera feed is mirrored like a selfie for a natural, intuitive experience.
Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

What I learned: I underestimated how hard real time hand and movement tracking is. I learned to work with MediaPipe hand landmarks, tune pinch thresholds, smooth jitter, and map
normalized coordinates into canvas space while keeping the camera feed mirrored for a natural feel. I had to handle camera permissions, secure context requirements over HTTPS. I
optimized performance with separate overlay and paint canvases, requestAnimationFrame, device-pixel-ratio
scaling, and transparent UI so the camera view stays clean. I built undo and redo with lightweight history snapshots, added save to PNG, and kept the UI responsive under load. I also
added a fallback tracker for older browsers, defensive error handling for common camera failures, and quick diagnostics to validate sensitivity and smoothing. This project taught me to
measure latency, iterate on interaction details, and ship a simple gesture that feels intuitive in real time.
