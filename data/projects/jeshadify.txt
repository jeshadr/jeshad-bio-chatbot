What I Learned: From this project I learned the fundamentals of designing and building a modern website from scratch.
I gained experience coding responsive front-end interfaces with a focus on UI/UX best practices, and I saw first-hand how important it is to make sites work smoothly across different screen sizes and devices.
Working with Next.js and React taught me how to structure components effectively, manage state, and optimize performance.
I also picked up skills in styling with Tailwind, using TypeScript for type safety, and thinking about accessibility so that the portfolio is usable by a wider audience.
This project gave me confidence in translating a creative idea into a functional product and reinforced the value of clear design systems and consistency.
