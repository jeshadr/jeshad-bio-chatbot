What I Learned: I learned how to design a mobile-first experience with ASP.NET Web Forms and make it feel smooth on phones and desktops.
I built interactive UI with JavaScript for menu selections, spice-level toggles, and a dynamic cart, and styled everything cleanly with CSS.
I connected the app to Azure for hosting and deployment, and picked up best practices for state management inside Web Forms.
I realized how much thought goes into simple UX details like responsive layout, input validation, and recalculating totals without lag.
This project gave me confidence in mixing .NET backends with front-end interactivity and shipping something a friend could use on their phone.
